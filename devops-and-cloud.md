# Interview Preparation for CJ

Have a look at the [About Us](README.md) section in the interview preparation for our full stack engineers, to make sure
this company seems like a good fit for you

## Devops and Cloud Engineer Position

We will be discussing your experience as a contributor to cloud architecture code, and as a lead, we will expect you to
have opinions on better or worse ways to keep complex cloud applications easy to maintain. You don't have to convince us
your opinions are correct, but you should be able to articulate your rationale for your opinions, how strongly you hold
those opinions, and what it would take for you to change your mind.

Think about how you deal with testing, provisioning, deployment, automation, backup/restore, monitoring, configuration
organization, and configuration reuse. You should be able to give plausible answers for how you would keep all of these
aspects of the application maintainable even as the feature set increases in both number and complexity.
